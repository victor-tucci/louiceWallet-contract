# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run deploy/[1_*, 2_*, ....]
```
For verify the contracts

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network amoy DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "constructorArg1" "constructorArg2"
```
