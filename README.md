# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/execute.js
```
For verify the contracts

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network polygon DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "constructorArg1" "constructorArg2"
```
